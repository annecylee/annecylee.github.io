At Qunar Mobile, we designed travel app for users to book flights, hotels and other travel services on their mobile phones or tablets. This project was to redesign flights booking process. I reconstructed interface architecture and information architecture.

<info>WALKTHROUGH</info>

First of all, I detected existing problems by reviewing the old design flows. And I found that the main problem was disregarding user’s behavior in different the context. 

<div class="col-sm-4">

<p>
  <b>Old Design Problems</b>
  <li>Flight info was not intuitive </li>
  <li>Too much content, repeating info in multiple processes</li>
  <li>Visual hierarchy was not clear</li>
  <li>Not focused on users’ main task</li>
</p>

<info> RESEARCH</info>
In order to understand what information user was looking for in different steps, I conducted a card sorting research. 19 cards were prepared. Content topics included ticket price, flight time/day, on-time performance,  aircraft type, etc.

</div> 

8 users were recruited. They were asked to group information they cared in different steps. Then they ranked and named each group of cards. After analyzed data, I had some preliminary understandings of user’s behavior in different contexts.

An online survey was conducted to gather more general information, and to create user personas.The survey included questions on users’ travel patterns and their online booking behaviors.

262 responses were collected. My coworkers and I analyzed the data, and applied the survey results to create user personas.

<info> DESIGN</info>
Drawing on my insights, I developed interface hypotheses by sketching, wireframing and prototyping.

<info>EXAMPLES</info>

Information Redesign Examples  
Old version was hard to understand. So we restructured flight info to make sure that new info structure was easy to understand and target.

Interaction Redesign Examples  
1. I reconstructed the hierarchy of Booking Page Hierarchy and designed new gestures for users to interact with the new interface. In old version, the visual hierarchy was not clear, user could not focus on main task. New design focused on user’s main task - passenger info input.

2. Another example is redesigning filter on Searching Result Page.Instead of using side drawer filter, modal filter was applied in the new design to make workflow more smoothly.

Functional Design Example    
We designed a price calendar for checking round-trip ticket price . X-axis represents departure date and y-axis represents return date. A given point in the coordinate represents the cheapest price for a round trip. When user’s flight dates are flexible , this calendar allows user to instantly compare prices with different combinations of date and length of stay.

<info>TESTING</info>    
Testing was followed at different points, either before launch or after launch, to ensure application's usability.

A/B Test Examples   
When data extraction takes time, only few flights will be presented at first. In this case, how to let user know that more information is loading? Two solutions were provided, and an A/B test was followed to choose a better experience.
