To filter content in Q&A, users need to send specific messages. Those messages are captured by script and sent them to the emulator as button input.  
Examples:  1. @ north park : show results only associated with the  keyword ‘north park’  2. -restaurant: remove results associated with the negative keyword ‘restaurant’  3. <3mi: show results  less than 3mi  away
